# Project Description

The Smart City Safety Management project is dedicated to revolutionizing urban safety. Through cutting-edge data analytics, real-time monitoring, and the development of a prototype safety application, we strive to detect and tackle safety issues swiftly. Our repository encompasses datasets, Jupyter Notebooks, a prototype app, and comprehensive documentation. Join us in crafting a safer and more intelligent urban environment.. The project is submitted and conducted to under the guidance of Professor Reda Mastouri.

# Methodology 
Our approach involves a structured analysis pipeline, encompassing data loading, exploration, preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation, and detailed interpretation. We aim to leverage various machine learning algorithms to model and predict emergency events based on the provided data.

This project not only provides an opportunity to delve into the intricacies of emergency notifications but also showcases the application of machine learning in the field of public safety.

Stay tuned for detailed insights into the dataset, model performances, and key takeaways as we embark on this exploration of NYCEM Emergency Notifications.
